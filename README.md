# DAWhiteMagic
Interop used in Rain

WorldOfWarcraft has it's own blackmagic, graymagic, and whitemagic.dll's all inspired
by Shynd. Who used to code, and play darkages as weel a long time ago.

Therefore to keep with the tradition, I created DAWhiteMagic.dll

If you can use this .dll please do, it has a full copyleft license.
