# DAWhiteMagic
Interop used in Rain

WorldOfWarcraft has had it's own blackmagic, graymagic, and whitemagic.dll's for awhile now.
They were all inspired by Shynd. Who coincidentially used to code, and play darkages.

Therefore to keep with the tradition, I created DAWhiteMagic.dll

If you can use this .dll please do, it has a full copyleft license.
